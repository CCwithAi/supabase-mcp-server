# Safety tools descriptions

live_dangerously: |
  Toggle unsafe mode for either Management API or Database operations.

  WHAT THIS TOOL DOES:
  This tool switches between safe (default) and unsafe operation modes for either the Management API or Database operations.

  SAFETY MODES EXPLAINED:
  1. Database Safety Modes:
     - READONLY mode (safe, default): Only SELECT queries and other read operations are allowed
     - READWRITE mode (unsafe): All SQL operations including INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and schema changes are permitted

  2. API Safety Modes:
     - SAFE mode (default): Only read operations that don't modify state are allowed
     - UNSAFE mode: State-changing operations are permitted (except those explicitly blocked for safety)

  WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:
  - Use this tool BEFORE attempting write operations or schema changes
  - Enable unsafe mode only when you need to perform data modifications
  - Always return to safe mode after completing write operations

  USAGE GUIDELINES:
  - Start in safe mode by default for exploration and analysis
  - Switch to unsafe mode only when you need to make changes
  - Be specific about which service you're enabling unsafe mode for
  - Consider the risks before enabling unsafe mode, especially for database operations
  - For database operations requiring schema changes, you'll need to enable unsafe mode first

  Parameters:
  - service: Which service to toggle ("api" or "database")
  - enable: True to enable unsafe mode, False for safe mode (default: False)

  Examples:
  1. Enable database write mode:
     live_dangerously(service="database", enable=True)

  2. Return to safe mode after operations:
     live_dangerously(service="database", enable=False)

  3. Enable API write operations:
     live_dangerously(service="api", enable=True)

  Note: This tool affects ALL subsequent operations for the specified service until changed again.

get_management_api_safety_rules: |
  Get all safety rules for the Supabase Management API.

  Returns a comprehensive overview of all safety rules applied to the Management API, including:
  - Blocked operations (never allowed)
  - Unsafe operations (allowed only in unsafe mode)
  - Safe operations (always allowed)

  Each rule includes:
  - The HTTP method and path pattern
  - A human-readable explanation of why the operation has its safety designation
  - The safety level assigned to the operation

  This information helps you understand which operations require unsafe mode and why certain operations might be completely blocked for safety reasons.
