# Database tool descriptions

get_db_schemas: |
  List all database schemas with their sizes and table counts.

  Returns a comprehensive overview of all schemas in the database, including:
  - Schema names
  - Total size of each schema
  - Number of tables in each schema
  - Owner information

  This is useful for getting a high-level understanding of the database structure.

get_tables: |
  List all tables, foreign tables, and views in a schema with their sizes, row counts, and metadata.

  Provides detailed information about all database objects in the specified schema:
  - Table/view names
  - Object types (table, view, foreign table)
  - Row counts
  - Size on disk
  - Column counts
  - Index information
  - Last vacuum/analyze times

  Parameters:
  - schema_name: Name of the schema to inspect (e.g., 'public', 'auth', etc.)

get_table_schema: |
  Get detailed table structure including columns, keys, and relationships.

  Returns comprehensive information about a specific table's structure:
  - Column definitions (names, types, constraints)
  - Primary key information
  - Foreign key relationships
  - Indexes
  - Constraints
  - Triggers

  Parameters:
  - schema_name: Name of the schema (e.g., 'public', 'auth')
  - table: Name of the table to inspect

execute_postgresql: |
  Execute PostgreSQL statements against your Supabase database.

  OPERATION TYPES AND REQUIREMENTS:
  1. READ Operations (SELECT, EXPLAIN, etc.):
     - Can be executed directly without special requirements
     - Example: SELECT * FROM public.users LIMIT 10;

  2. WRITE Operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE):
     - Require READWRITE mode (use live_dangerously('database', True) first)
     - MUST use explicit transaction blocks (BEGIN/COMMIT)
     - Example:
       BEGIN;
       INSERT INTO public.users (email) VALUES ('user@example.com');
       COMMIT;

  3. SCHEMA Operations (CREATE, ALTER, DROP):
     - Require READWRITE mode (use live_dangerously('database', True) first)
     - MUST use explicit transaction blocks (BEGIN/COMMIT)
     - Destructive operations (DROP, TRUNCATE) require additional confirmation
     - Example:
       BEGIN;
       CREATE TABLE public.test_table (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
       COMMIT;

  TRANSACTION HANDLING:
  - The server detects BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK keywords to respect your transaction control
  - When you use these keywords, the server will not interfere with your transactions
  - For queries without transaction control, the server will auto-commit in read mode only
  - WRITE and SCHEMA operations without transaction blocks will be rejected
  - This ensures atomicity and provides rollback capability for data modifications

  CONFIRMATION FLOW FOR HIGH-RISK OPERATIONS:
  - High-risk operations (DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, etc.) will be rejected with a confirmation ID
  - The error message will explain what happened and provide a confirmation ID
  - Review the risks with the user before proceeding
  - Use the confirm_destructive_postgresql tool with the provided ID to execute the operation

  IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
  - The database client starts in READONLY mode by default for safety
  - Only enable READWRITE mode when you need to modify data or schema
  - Never mix READ and WRITE operations in the same transaction
  - For destructive operations, be prepared to confirm with the confirm_destructive_postgresql tool

  WHEN TO USE OTHER TOOLS INSTEAD:
  - For Auth operations (users, authentication, etc.): Use call_auth_admin_method instead of direct SQL
    The Auth Admin SDK provides safer, validated methods for user management
  - For project configuration, functions, storage, etc.: Use send_management_api_request
    The Management API handles Supabase platform features that aren't directly in the database

  Note: This tool operates on the PostgreSQL database only. API operations use separate safety controls.

confirm_destructive_postgresql: |
  Execute a destructive database operation after confirmation. Use this only after reviewing the risks with the user.

  HOW IT WORKS:
  - This tool executes a previously rejected high-risk operation using its confirmation ID
  - The operation will be exactly the same as the one that generated the ID
  - No need to retype the query - the system remembers it

  STEPS:
  1. Explain the risks to the user and get their approval
  2. Use this tool with the confirmation ID from the error message
  3. The original query will be executed as-is

  PARAMETERS:
  - confirmation_id: The ID provided in the error message (required)
  - user_confirmation: Set to true to confirm execution (default: false)

  NOTE: Confirmation IDs expire after 5 minutes for security

retrieve_migrations: |
  Retrieve a list of all migrations a user has from Supabase.
